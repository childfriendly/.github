# Lviv — Friendly to Families and Children

**“Lviv — Friendly to Families and Children”** is a civic initiative that unites active parents who strive to improve urban conditions for pregnancy, childbirth, and raising children.

The initiative emerged in 2014 on Facebook, where previously unacquainted young parents joined forces with a shared goal: to make Lviv a more comfortable, accessible, and inclusive city for families. We believe that parents themselves have both the responsibility and the power to influence and transform the environment around them.

Today, the community includes nearly **1,800 parents**, with more than **20 actively involved** in designing and implementing projects.

## Organization

In 2016, the initiative formally registered as the NGO  
**“Parents in Action” (Батьки в дії)**.

Since then, we have:

- implemented dozens of city-wide projects  
- organized workshops, lectures, and public events for active and future parent leaders  
- promoted gender equality and equal opportunities for women and men  
- studied best practices from other cities  
- collaborated with local authorities to influence policies affecting families  
- implemented inclusion projects and accessibility advocacy initiatives  

Parents with young children belong to low-mobility population groups, which gives us a direct interest in promoting universal accessibility in the city.
